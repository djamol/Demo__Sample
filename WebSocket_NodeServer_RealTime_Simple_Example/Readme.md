In this example, the server generates a unique session ID for each client and sends it back to the client upon connection. The server stores the session ID along with the WebSocket connection object in the sessions Map. When you want to send an event to a specific client, you can retrieve the WebSocket connection object using the session ID from the sessions Map and send the event using the send method.
